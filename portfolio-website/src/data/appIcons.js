/**
 * appIcons.js
 * ===========
 * 
 * Overview:
 * A module for managing application icons with their associated paths and URLs.
 * Provides a consistent interface for icon handling across the application.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Icon object creation with validation
 * - Path management for container and icon SVGs
 * - URL handling for profile links
 * - Searchable icon collection
 * 
 * Technical Implementation:
 * - Object-oriented design with immutable instances
 * - Efficient icon search functionality
 * - Type-safe path and URL management

/* Icon Instances
 =============
 Below this point, multiple AppIconObject instances are declared for various
 social media and platform icons. Each instance contains:
 - The platform name
 - Profile URL (if applicable)
 - SVG paths for both container and icon
 
 For maintenance purposes, instances are grouped by platform type:
 - Professional networks (LinkedIn, GitHub)
 - Social platforms (Discord, X/Twitter)
 - Gaming platforms (Itch.io)
 - Portfolio sites (TheXPlace, YoungArts)
 - Communication platforms (ProtonMail)
